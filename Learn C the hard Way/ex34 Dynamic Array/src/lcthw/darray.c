	// I don't understand why the size is set at expand_rate + 1, maybe so that it don't go out of bounds ??
	// or as the size is n the indexes would only go to n-1, therefore the extra 1 at the end
	// Also why are we setting the new memory region with 0 upto 300 indexes ????
	// Ans 1) See the reason why we are initializing expand rate + 1 is bcz consider this, we have a base address of 1000 and we want to set bytes up to and including 1050 to 0, this means we have 51 mean pry locations not 50 
	// Ans 2) Yes somewhat I think my logic was not exactly right but I was getting there 
	// Ans 3) We are not starting from the base address, see if my base address was 1000 and I have 50 elements then I have nemory filled up to 1050 and say I want to add another 50 using realloc, well doing so would give me 50 garbage values, so we would start with 1050 (base + old size) up to 50 bytes ahead(51 if we include the address 1050 itself) which is basically the size
