// Original Function
// Function to create a Hashmap and you have to provide a compare and hash generating function
// for the specific datatype that you wish to use as a key
Hashmap * Hashmap_create(Hashmap_compare, Hashmap_hash); // Default Implementation

// Improvement 2.1 : Lets the user specificically decide the size of the buckets (non-resizable)

// Improvement 2.2 : Lets the user define an initial capacity / bucket size and a load factor

size_t Hashmap_getSize(Hashmap * map);

// Function to traverse the hashmap and you have to provide how each of the node gets traversed
int Hashmap_traverse(Hashmap* map, Hashmap_traverse_cb traverse_cb);

// Function to remove a key value pair from the map
void * Hashmap_delete(Hashmap* map, void* key);

// Improvements

// 1. Sort each of the bucket so that we can use binary search to find the element, this would increase
// insertion time but decreases the searching time since currently it used linear search to find the keys
// include the darray_algos header file and use the required functions
/* Improvement 1 - Done */
 
// 2. To dynamically size the number of buckets or let the caller specify the number of buckets
// for each hashmap created
/* Some points regarding dynamically sizing the hashmap:
 > When you resize a hashmap you have to also update their positions of elements 
   based on the new size of the buckets and this process is called Re-Hashing.
 > the average number of entries in a bucket (which is the total number of entries 
   divided by the number of buckets) should give a good estimate on when the HashMap 
   should be resized, and the size of individual buckets doesn't need to be checked.
 > To consider a threshold, and if the threshold reaches a certain value then we know
   that its time to resize the map.
*/
/* Improvement 2.1 - Done */ // Lets the user decide the default no. of buckets

// don't define functions in your header if you don't want multiple definitions
// rather just define them static inline or just static so they are local to the Translation Units
/*
static inline size_t Hashmap_getThreshold(Hashmap * map)
{
	return (size_t)(map->bucket_size * map->load_factor);
}
*/

/* Improvement 2.2 - Done */ // Now the map gets resized automatically after the entries exceed the threshold
